The goal of this report is to create an algorithm that will give location regions where one should open their venue given the category of venue it is. This will be done using Foursquare's search and explore tools which allow us to see the amount of venues with a similar category, and observe the trends of that area using the trending command on the API. The Peel Region consists of 3 cities, Caledon, Brampton, and Mississauga and data for this region will be collected off of the internet. Imagine an entrepreneur wants to open a Chinese grocery store but doesn't know which region to open such store. This algorithm will give the entrepreneur some options on which locations are best for their decision based on the ethnicity of the general population in a given city and the amount of venues with the same business idea in the area already. The higher the population that will be in favour for the store opening, the better \"score\" it gets regarding the final decision made, but if there is already multiple stores in the area with the same business idea,  the lower \"score\" it will receive. This is just a simple example and there will be many other factors that go into the final decision by the algorithm. Now that the purpose of this report is stated, we are left with the question on what ` of data we will need to finish this assignment."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Data Section"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "For our report, we will need valuable data from the Foursuqare API and also information off of the internet. From foursquare, we will need venue data based around whatever category the venue we are trying to open falls into. From that data, we will receive the name, category, location, and unique ID for those venues. From that we can analyze the category and location. Another set of data we will need to acquire will be from other online sources which will be the ethnicity distribution in the 3 cities in The Peel Region and their respective neighbourhoods which can be found on that particular city's wikipedia page. That information can easily be scraped in python due to the data already being in charts on wikipedia. If there are any difficulties scraping the data we can write it down manually because it isn't a lot of data that we need to scrap regardless. When all of this data is required, we can create maps to visualize the data using folium, create charts and graphs for the ethnicity distribution of the locations and lastly come up with a model that will allow us to recommend a  city or neighbourhood that is the ideal spot to open the venue that a client wants to build.
